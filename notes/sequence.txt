GeekNight - Multi-paradigm programming in Scala and Akka

6:45 - 7:00 => Intro to FP from OOP.
7:00 - 7:30 => 

Introduction to OOP and FP through Scala.
- Scala is a pure OOP language.
- Scala implements Functional Programming over a pure OOP base.

The following is just enough Scala to demonstrate the example.

Functional Programming (with examples in Scala)
- Referential Transparency
- Immutability (will be important for akka)
- Pattern Matching

Object-oriented enhancements
- traits
- case classes
- implicits

7:45 - 8:00 => Intro to Actor Model / Whatsapp / Erlang.
8:00 - 8:30 => Introduction and demo of Akka.

Historical quote:
- Actors are what objects were supposed to be.

Actors communicate like people
- Actors as a concurrency solution
- Actors can be parallelized too!

Reactive programming - responsive, resilient, elastic, message-driven

Demonstrate the code example and show how Scala makes it easy to build actor systems.
